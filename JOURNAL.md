## 10/25/2025 - Joined Blueprint! Updated my Blueprint with current progress  

I started this project like two weeks ago as a my first PCB project, and only now did I realize there was a YSWS for this exact thing lmfao.
When I started this project, I hooked up Hackatime to my KiCad, and made a nice little schematic for this, and also started routing this board. The schematic is just an Arduino Micro Pro, connected to three PCF8575s, that then routes into 10 CD4066s. This is then hooked into a common bus and a ribbon connector, which is supposed to short two pins of the matrix at a time. The 10 CD4066s are insane to route, so I'm currently trying to find another SPST chip that isn't a bajillion dollars. This is still an improvement from my previous plan of 90 MOSFET switches for my first prototype! Schematics attached below!
