## 10/25/2025 3 PM - Joined Blueprint! Updated my Blueprint with current progress  

I started this project like two weeks ago as a my first PCB project, and only now did I realize there was a YSWS for this exact thing lmfao.
When I started this project, I hooked up Hackatime to my KiCad, and made a nice little schematic for this, and also started routing this board. The schematic is just an Arduino Micro Pro, connected to three PCF8575s, that then routes into 10 CD4066s. This is then hooked into a common bus and a ribbon connector, which is supposed to short two pins of the matrix at a time. The 10 CD4066s are insane to route, so I'm currently trying to find another SPST chip that isn't a bajillion dollars. This is still an improvement from my previous plan of 90 MOSFET switches for my first prototype! Schematics attached below!

## 10/25/2025 6 PM - Redesigned PCB!  

I did not like the crowded method of having a PCF8575 IC expander that then connects into CD4066s, so I did the logical thing and went hunting for a higher channel capacity SPST switch, which lead me to find the (relatively) cheap MAX335, a chip with 8 seperately controlled SPST switches (double what the CD4066 had, with only 4 SPST switches), and ALSO support daisy chaining (using the SPI interface instead of the I2C interface the PFC8575 used), which halved the amount of analog switch chips I needed, and also removed the need for the PFC8575 chips since everything is daisy-chained! Now I need to actually do routing lmao.
OH YEAH ALSO i added decaps. very silly.
Schematics attached below!

## 10/26/2025 1 PM - Routed the PCB  

This was two days of my life, mostly because of the fact that I have never done anything like this before (not even the "Hello world" of PCBCADing, I skipped the humble LED + Resistor intro and dived DIRECTLY INTO WHATEVER THIS IS!)
![image](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NTYzMCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--c8a34838a62289a7798358e25650596cbfd47e8d/image.png)

My routing is a bit horrible but I managed to get this done at last. I also learnt about the existence of power and ground fills (and how it's SUPPOSED to reduce interference?) so like I used them in the GND and VCC layers of my board!
PCB attached below:

## 10/26/2025 2 PM - Cleaned up the PCB  

I'm writing this in a haste. I redid some of the connections that looked weird or that could be optimized, and stuck the branding on there as well. Reminder to self to start taking measurements and finish the pogo board by today, as well as silkscreen the github urb and credits onto the board.

## 10/27/2025 - Made the second board and cleaned up the PCB (Pt. 2)  

I did all the required measurements for the second interface board that is supposed to make the connection between the calculator and my logic board... even made a script that explores the best possible arrangement for the pins such that there wouldn't be any overlaps between the routing:

Script here:

After that, I read through the devboard tutorial and realized I made many bad PCB mistakes (e.g. not dogbone'ing my vias, caps way bigger than required, yada yada)... so I redid my routing. it still has many problems with it but I'm just so done with PCBing for today:

Maybe I'll tank tonight out and fix up my horrible choices? I don't know... I have a robotics competition tomorrow...  

## 10/28/2025 - Readme'ing and DNSing  

I wrote a nice little readme on my github page, and spent another good portion of today night to make both https://calcwriter.sillyy.gay and http://calcwriter.sillyy.gay redirect to https://github.com/CastyLoz17/calcwriter_blueprint using Cloudfare. This took way too long. I suck at DNS records. This sucks.

note to self to clean up pcb after I return from tomorrow's competition.  

## 10/29/2025 - Swapped Arduino out for SOC  

Title says it all! I swapped the Sparkfun Micro Pro with a SOC (More specifically, the ATmega32U4) to be put directly onto the board! Right now though, its just the schematics only, and I haven't wired the main components yet (e.g. Only connected the USB-C header and crystal oscillator)
![image](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NjI3MSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--443b327f9152ba3afd577f4e6b45a47ea60960b7/image.png)
Also, before that, I cleaned up my PCB for the... I-don't-even-know-anymore-th time... so theres that!
Tomorrow, I'll work on reworking my old SPST Analog Switches with absolutely horrible wiring, with some new schematics with nets and stuff, connect the SOC to the Analog Switches, and maaaybe start working on connecting the SOC to the main board if I have the time?
I also realized my Interface board was in the wrong orientation, and had to be flipped over. I was SOOOO close to hand-doing it until my lord and savior Keyaan said that I could just move components from one side of the board to the other side, and vice versa. This tip helped me save so much time, I CANNOT thank you enough!
All in all a very long day (Microchip Technologies make HORRIBLE docs), but I'm glad I got things done.  

## 10/30/2025 - Swapped Arduino out for SOC (on the PCB!)  

I have gone TOO long without writing a journal entry, and it's ITCHING ASKJFHAJLFHSDKJFHAL
I've done a LOT in the past 2 days:
- Finished and cleaned up Schematics
- Swapped out the Arduino out for a ATmega32U4
- REwired my PCB because I changed some stuff in the schematics

The following is... TWO WHOLE DAMN DAYS OF WORK!
![image](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NjczMiwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--7ddf8a361f9bbe0b0d926d8b05d6cb43f957890b/image.png)

Next up, I'll optimize the PCB, and then ship this project!
also, say hi to Goober!
![image](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NjczMywicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--cc9540155ec39c9dcf3785410ea4c9dfdfb94f4b/image.png)

p.s. Don't mind the mismatched holes at the top, I forgot to refill copper fills before taking a screenshot and am too lazy to fix.  

## 10/31/2025 - Fixed some mistakes, made vias bigger (for cost efficiency)  

So... apparently my board was not cost-efficient as I had to use 0.15mm via hole sizes, and the blueprint people were not too happy about that. The base via hole size JLC offers is 0.3mm hole size, so I had to go through and change every via to be double its size! AAAAND then I did one final sanity check and realized I have been using a 48 pin chip instead of the 44 pin I should be using, which means I had to redo the SOC since it was the wrong footprint. At long last this (should) be done! unless... I figure out how to remove the last horizontal CD4066 chip somehow? that would make my board way shorter... if only there was a way to employ the GPIO pins... I'll think about this overnight

PCB below!:

## 11/3/2025 - light rerouting and some styling  

explorpheus!

i also did a bit of cleaning up (again), made the board a biiitt shorter and way more appealing. also printed the outline out using my 3d printer and i like the size! thats silly heh
welp theres nothing left to do except writing the github and also some simple blinky firmware and then shipping! 4 days till november 7th and im proud of meh speed!
