# the "do whatever you want just don't sue me" license

**aka MIT License but make it _spicy_**

Copyright (c) 2025 Kaemori Yozzan, downright.sillyy@gmail.com

## the deal:

you can literally do ANYTHING with this code. seriously. anything. here's what that means:

-   ✅ use it (duh)
-   ✅ copy it
-   ✅ modify it (make it better, make it worse, make it do crimes in minecraft)
-   ✅ merge it with other stuff
-   ✅ publish it (show it off to your friends)
-   ✅ distribute it (share the love)
-   ✅ sublicense it (idk what this means but lawyers care about it)
-   ✅ sell it (capitalist moment but hey get that bag)

## the only rules:

1. **keep this silly license notice** in all copies or substantial portions of the code. that's it. that's the rule.

2. if you redistribute it, include this license and the copyright notice above. just copy-paste it. easy peasy.

## the "please don't sue me" part:

this software is provided "AS IS" - meaning if it breaks, sets your computer on fire, or accidentally launches the nukes, that's not my problem bestie :3c

NO WARRANTY OF ANY KIND. it might work perfectly, it might summon eldritch horrors. who knows!

the authors or copyright holders are NOT LIABLE for anything that happens. your project explodes? skill issue. your production server catches fire? shoulda tested it. your blahaj becomes sentient? actually that's a feature.

## tl;dr:

do whatever the fuck you want with this code, just don't blame me if shit goes sideways and keep this goofy license attached. stay hydrated!

_this is a legally equivalent rewrite of the MIT License but significantly more entertaining. if your lawyers hate fun, the boring version is available at opensource.org_
